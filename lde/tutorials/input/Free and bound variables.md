This tutorial assumes you know how to construct LC instances; if not, see
the tutorial on {@tutorial Constructing LCs}.  This tutorial covers what it
means for a symbol to be free or bound inside an LC tree.

(Each piece of sample code below is written as if it were a script sitting in
the root folder of this source code repository, and run from there with the
command-line tools `node`.  If you place your scripts in another folder, you
will need to adjust the path in each `import` statement accordingly.  If you
have not yet set up a copy of this repository with the appropriate Node.js
version installed, see [our GitHub README](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde),
which explains how to do so.)

## Free variables vs. free symbols

Most situations that deal with the concepts of free/bound with respect to
binding expressions speak of free and bound *variables.*  But in the world of
LCs, we do not have variables as a specific category; we have only the
general category of *symbols* that can be used as variables or constants.
Thus here we will speak of free and bound symbols.

The concept of a bound variable has the usual meaning:  Inside any
{@link Binding Binding} expression `(head sym1 sym2 ... symN , body)`, the
symbols `sym1` through `symN` are bound.  Outside of that expression (assuming
there is no containing binding expression of the same symbol(s)), they are not
bound, and are thus called free.

```js
import { LogicConcept } from './src/index.js'

const binding = LogicConcept.fromPutdown( '(forall x , (P x))' )[0]
binding.descendantsSatisfying( d => d.isAtomic() ).map( d => {
    console.log( 'Is', d.toPutdown(), 'free?', d.isFree() )
} )
```

You can also ask the question relatively:  Is a symbol free in a specific
ancestor?

```js
const outerBinding = LogicConcept.fromPutdown( '(exists x , (forall y , (> x y)))' )[0]
const innerBinding = outerBinding.body()
const secondX = innerBinding.body().child( 1 )
console.log( 'Is x free in the inner binding?', secondX.isFree( innerBinding ) )
console.log( 'Is x free in the outer binding?', secondX.isFree( outerBinding ) )
```

The {@link MathConcept#isFree isFree()} method works not only for symbols.
You can ask whether a nonatomic expression is free, and it will be free if and
only if all of the symbols free within it are free in the given context.

```js
console.log( innerBinding.body().isFree( innerBinding ) )
```

## Free occurrences

We can also ask whether a symbol {@link MathConcept#occursFree occurs free}
anywhere in an expression.  Note the difference between `x.occursFree(y)` and
`y.occursFree(x)` and that the order may be different from what you expect.

```js
import { LurchSymbol } from './src/index.js'

const example = LogicConcept.fromPutdown( '(and (> x 1) (forall x , (R x x)))' )[0]
console.log( 'Last x free?', example.child( 2 ).body().child( 2 ).isFree() )
console.log( 'Any x free?', example.occursFree( new LurchSymbol( 'x' ) ) )
```

You can get all free occurrences by combining
{@link MathConcept#descendantsSatisfying descendantsSatisfying()} with
{@link MathConcept#isFree isFree()}.

## Variable capture and replacing free occurrences

The usual notion of variable capture exists when considering substitution into
a binding, and you can check to see if it will happen using
{@link MathConcept#isFreeToReplace isFreeToReplace()}.  You can do all of the
free replacements with {@link MathConcept#replaceFree replaceFree()}.

```js
console.log( 'Before:', example.toPutdown() )
example.replaceFree(
    new LurchSymbol( 'x' ),
    LogicConcept.fromPutdown( '(- 3 x)' )[0] )
console.log( 'After:', example.toPutdown() )
```
